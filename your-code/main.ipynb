If you encounter errors in converting strings to numeric values, you need to catch those errors and force the conversion by supplying `errors='coerce'` as an argument for `pandas.to_numeric`. Coercing will replace non-convertable elements with `NaN` which represents an undefined numeric value. This makes it possible for us to conveniently handle missing values in subsequent data processing.\n","\n","*Hint: you may use a loop to change one column at a time but it is more efficient to use `apply`.*"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tGsqzGiDzB6j","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638378567324,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":35,"user":{"displayName":"stanley rocha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjMNY_lsTff3Cyv6WkVaji2_h6SnUl2XjcVhvzdaEM=s64","userId":"00951066335831658539"}}},"source":["wrong_type_columns = ['DewPointHighF', 'DewPointAvgF', 'DewPointLowF', 'HumidityHighPercent', \n","                      'HumidityAvgPercent', 'HumidityLowPercent', 'SeaLevelPressureHighInches', \n","                      'SeaLevelPressureAvgInches' ,'SeaLevelPressureLowInches', 'VisibilityHighMiles',\n","                      'VisibilityAvgMiles', 'VisibilityLowMiles', 'WindHighMPH', 'WindAvgMPH', \n","                      'WindGustMPH', 'PrecipitationSumInches']"],"execution_count":75,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fies_zoVzB6n","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1638378567326,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":36,"user":{"displayName":"stanley rocha","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjMNY_lsTff3Cyv6WkVaji2_h6SnUl2XjcVhvzdaEM=s64","userId":"00951066335831658539"}}},"source":["# Your code here\n","for column in wrong_type_columns:\n","  austin_weather[column]= pd.to_numeric(austin_weather[column],errors='coerce')\n","\n"],"execution_count":76,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GKkKFHsRzB6o"},"source":["#### Check if your code has worked by printing the data types again.

In this challenge we'll show you another way which is to use the Python `datetime` library's `toordinal()` function.
